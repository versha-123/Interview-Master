KAHN's ALGO FOR TOPOLOGICAL SORT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tggiFvaxjrY
https://cses.fi/problemset/result/3359051/ (IMPORTANT)

Kahn can also solve (Topo sort)
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix

longest path in DAG

Bipartite graph

0-1 BFS is better then djikstra's

(IMPORTANT) if multiparameter djikstra is asked, focus on both variables

[IMPORTANT] Good variation of BFS, if multiple nodes are to be visited (USING BITMASK IN VISITED ALONG WITH NODE)
